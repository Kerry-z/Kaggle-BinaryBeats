Team of NYU-DL-Fall-24-Kaggle-Competition, named Binary Beats. Our focus is on the Supervised-Fine Tuning (SFT) of the Llama3-8B model to evaluate the correctness of answers to mathematics questions. Our aim is to create a reliable model that can determine if a provided answer to a math problem is correct or incorrect.
